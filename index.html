            <p>
                welcome to a messy website i put together because i had nothing to do
            </p>

            <p>
                anyways i draw, code some weird stuff, and play tetr.io all day
            </p>

            <p>
                you can navigate with the navigation bar at the top of the screen
            </p>

            <h1>but aiden,, why did you make this website!?</h1>
            <p>first off i had nothing to do, as i said already</p>
            <p>second, i just wanted to make a website so that people can get to know more about me in a way that like<br>"releases" my personality in a way<br>if you have eyes you can see the doodles</p>
            <p>i used to host my website on neocities, but i did not like the limits so i switched to <br>github + pages.dev</p><p>you can learn more about why on <a href="posts/github-is-wonderful.html">this post!</a></p>
            <p>anyway, i just put little experiments/projects i put in here, my socials, and my posts<br>so that counts as the "get to know more about me" part.</p>
            <p>"enjoy" the website i guess, and browse!</p>
